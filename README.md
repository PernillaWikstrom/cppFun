This repository is a place to develop skills in C++. 
I have made a few different projects varying in quality, entertainment and complexity.

- The diamond: lets the user input a number from the terminal that will determine the size of the diamond.
- Conway Game of life: simulates cellular automation [url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
